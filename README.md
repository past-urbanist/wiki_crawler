# Cities of Global - Wikipedia Crawler
<p>Created by Keer Zhang.</p>
<p>This document simply illustrates the process from crawling to database storage, to analyis and visualization. And some parts merely show parts of codes, since original codes are in .py files.</p>
<p>This task is aimed to collect the information of every city on Earth (10838 cities from 148 nations/districts in the world), based on the imformation on Wekipedia. I have used the Request & Scrapy methods and so on to accomplish my task.</p>
<p>As for visualization, I have employed geopandas to demonstrate the distribution of cites globally.
